# 🌟 DSA Journey – My Practice & Learning Repository

Welcome to my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** practice repository!  
I'm currently learning DSA step by step and sharing all my solved exercises, notes, and concepts here.

## 📚 What You’ll Find in This Repo

- ✅ Basic Sorting Algorithms (Bubble, Insertion, Selection, etc.)
- ✅ Searching Techniques (Linear, Binary Search)
- ✅ Recursion Problems
- ✅ Stack, Queue, Linked List (coming soon...)
- ✅ Java-based DSA implementations (more languages later)

> I'm using **Java** as my primary language, but the logic is language-independent and can be applied elsewhere.

## 👨‍💻 Why This Repo?

This is part of my personal learning path in computer science and software development.  
The best way to get better at problem solving is **practice** — and this repo keeps me consistent.
